## Overview

Welcome to HomeMovieHub! It is a Vue 3 and Laravel 10 Web-App designed to create a streaming experience for home movies. The app combines the power of Vue & Laravel to create a Netflix-like experience to users and a safe place to store their precious footage.

## Features

### Netflix-like UI


A nice and family UI allows users to easily navigate their collection.

### Personal Profiles

Users can have each family member as a profile, which can be tagged in videos!

### See locations

Using the integrated Google Maps, users can pin the locations in their videos, allowing a better perspective of where they have been in the world


## Future Planned Updates

The next release of HomeMovieHub is planned to include:

- **Email Verification** Added security for something as private as a place for home movies

- **Enhanced User Profiles:** Like Netflix, users will be able to have a family account, and then profiles for each member that they can secondarily login to.

- **Enhanced Maps:** Enhance the locations section by allowing users to add notes and pictures for each map location pin, essentially helping to detail the story behind the scenes.

- **Code Improvements:** Refine the user interface and codebase for an improved user experience.

- **CI/CD Implementation:** Integrate Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment processes with frontend testing to ensure a robust and reliable application.
